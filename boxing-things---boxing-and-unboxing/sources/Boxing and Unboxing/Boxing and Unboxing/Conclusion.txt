After running the program for 50 million values and reading more about boxing
and unboxing I came to a concluion.Unboxing is less costly than boxing as it 
only involves extracting a value from an existing object, rather than creating
a new one and copying the value from the stack to the heap.
Writing code without boxing and unboxing can reduce these costs, as it can 
eliminate the need for additional memory allocation.
